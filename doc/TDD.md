# BDD / TDD 

BDD ensures business rules are ok
TDD helps writing correct implementation

Here a typical workflow:

- Based on the BDD scenarios, write failing tests (one test per scenario) in the tests/HangmanTest.php file.
- Implement the minimal code required in the game.php file to make the failing tests pass.
- Focus on building the functionality step-by-step based on the tests.
- Once a test passes, refactor and improve the code for maintainability and readability without breaking the tests.
- Repeat for All Scenarios
- Continue iterating through BDD scenarios, writing failing tests, and implementing code to make them pass.
This ensures continuous testing and development guided by user stories.
