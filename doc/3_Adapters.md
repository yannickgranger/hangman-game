##  Implement Adapters:

- Create concrete implementations for domain interfaces within src/Infrastructure.
- These implementations handle interactions with external systems based on your chosen infrastructure (e.g., InMemoryWordRepository, DatabaseWordRepository for WordRepositoryInterface).
- Adapters translates between domain concepts and formats specific to external resources.

## Utilize Ports and Adapters:

Inject domain interfaces (e.g., WordRepositoryInterface) into your use cases and services.
This allows for dependency injection and flexibility when needed, like swapping out specific implementations.

- Use cases and services orchestrate domain logic and utilize adapters for external interactions.

- Benefits:
    - Separation of Concerns: Clear distinction between domain logic and infrastructure.
    - Increased Testability: Domain logic can be tested in isolation from external dependencies.
    - Improved Maintainability: Easier to modify or replace infrastructure components without impacting core logic.
    - Flexibility: Adapters allow for switching between different infrastructure solutions.

## Additional Notes:

- Consider using dependency injection to manage dependencies.
- Remember to write unit tests for your domain logic and integration tests for your use cases and adapters.
